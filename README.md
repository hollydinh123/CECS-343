INTRODUCTION:
This is the third part of our VCS (Version Control System) project. In addition to the first and second parts' functions, this part consists of implementing a merge function. Gives the user the ability to merge two project trees.


EXTERNAL REQUIREMENTS:
A Java IDE to run the program (i.e. Eclipse, drJava, Netbeans, etc.)
Windows OS recommended.


BUILD, INSTALLATION, AND SETUP:
1) Make sure all .java files are in the same folder.
2) Open up the Java IDE and create a new Java project.
3) Compile the Create_Repo.java, CheckIn.java, CheckOut.java, Merge.java, and Menu.java files.
4) Run the Menu.java file.
5) Input the directory name to create a repository. (i.e. C://Users/Computer1/Desktop/repo343)
6) Choose the directory to copy and where to copy it to.
7) Indicate the versions you would like to be merged.


USAGE:
This program is used for creating a repository, checking in an updated project tree to an existing repository, checking out a specific project tree from the repository into a different target directory, and for merging two project trees. The repository will store files and let users know the time when they are created, updated, have files checked in, and checked out. 


EXTRA FEATURES:
In our time stamps, we have the milliseconds of each time to have more specific times.


BUGS:
There is an error with the program reading the file name in the Merge.java class.
